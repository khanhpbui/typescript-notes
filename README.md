# typescript-notes

The purpose of creating this repository is to document my learning journey and take notes on TypeScript.

## What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript is a programming language and a superset of JavaScript. It is designed to provide optional static typing to JavaScript and to make it easier to develop large-scale applications.

- The purpose of TypeScript is to enhance the productivity and maintainability of JavaScript code, particularly in larger and more complex projects. By providing a type system, TypeScript helps catch potential errors at compile-time rather than at runtime, making code more robust and easier to maintain. 

- It also provides features such as interfaces and classes that are familiar to developers coming from statically-typed languages, making it easier to write and understand code. Additionally, TypeScript compiles to standard JavaScript, making it compatible with all major browsers and platforms.
